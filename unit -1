Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. 
You use React Components to build user interfaces,
Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.

🛣️ Two Types of Routing in Next.js
1. Page Routing (Using pages/ folder)
✅ Simple and easy – used in older versions
🔧 How it works:
Create a file → it becomes a page.
Good for small projects
Uses functions like getStaticProps and getServerSideProps for data
No server components or layouts  

2. App Routing (Using app/ folder)
✅ Modern and powerful – introduced in Next.js 13

🔧 How it works:
Create folders and use special files like:

page.js → for the page

layout.js → shared layout (header/footer)

loading.js → loading UI

error.js → error handling



**Building blocks of a web application
There are a few things you need to consider when building modern applications. Such as:

User Interface - how users will consume and interact with your application.
Routing - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
Data Fetching - where your data lives and how to get it.
Rendering - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
Integrations - what third-party services you use (for CMS, auth, payments, etc.) and how you connect to them.
Infrastructure - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (serverless, CDN, edge, etc.).
Performance - how to optimize your application for end-users.
Scalability - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
Developer Experience - your team's experience building and maintaining your application.
