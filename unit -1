🛣️ Two Types of Routing in Next.js
1. Page Routing (Using pages/ folder)
✅ Simple and easy – used in older versions
🔧 How it works:
Create a file → it becomes a page.
Good for small projects
Uses functions like getStaticProps and getServerSideProps for data
No server components or layouts  

2. App Routing (Using app/ folder)
✅ Modern and powerful – introduced in Next.js 13

🔧 How it works:
Create folders and use special files like:

page.js → for the page

layout.js → shared layout (header/footer)

loading.js → loading UI

error.js → error handling
